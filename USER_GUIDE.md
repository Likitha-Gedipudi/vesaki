## ✨ How to Use

### Step 1: Start with Your First Item
Type a description of any clothing item you like:

**Examples:**
- "red crop top from Zara"
- "black leather jacket"
- "blue jeans from H&M"
- "white Nike sneakers"

The AI will:
✓ Find the product for you
✓ Show it on your photo
✓ Display the product card with price and link

---

### Step 2: Add More Items to Build Your Outfit
Just keep adding items! The AI remembers what you're already wearing.

**Examples:**
```
You: "red crop top from Zara"
→ AI shows you wearing the red top

You: "black jeans from H&M"  
→ AI shows you wearing BOTH the red top AND black jeans together!

You: "white sneakers"
→ AI shows you wearing ALL THREE items as a complete outfit!
```

---

### Step 3: Swap Items Anytime
Want to try a different color or style? Just ask!

**Examples:**
```
You: "blue crop top instead"
→ The red top is replaced with the blue one
→ Your jeans and sneakers stay the same

You: "try a black leather jacket"
→ The jacket is added on top of your existing outfit
```
